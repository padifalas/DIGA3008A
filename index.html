    <h1> Setting Up GitHub: A Web Publishing Experience</h1>
    <p> Setting up Github and Github pages was a fascinating experience into modern online <br>
        publishing. I was fortunately already familiar with the basic fundamentals of the GitHub <br>
        platform like creating a repository and making a commit. These concepts are now essential <br>
         to web development and demonstrated the evolution of web publishing from the manual <br>
         HTML file transfers of the earlier days to he more recent automated tools. <br>
        Reading through the various readings has given me an interesting view on how the evolution of the internet.
        Many aspects of the modern intern seem to have been accurately predicated by by Borges (1941).<br>
         His idea of an endless library with every possible letter combination reflects the <br>
          information overload we face daily. We face similar difficulties in the era of search engines <br>
          and social media just like Borges' librarians did when they were trying to locate relevant <br>
          material among the many choices. </p>
