    <h1> Setting Up GitHub: A Web Publishing Experience</h1>
    <p> Setting up Github and Github pages was a fascinating experience into modern online
        publishing.  <br>I was fortunately already familiar with the basic fundamentals of the GitHub <br>
        platform like creating a repository and making a commit. These concepts are now essential <br>
         to web development and demonstrated the evolution of web publishing from the manual <br>
         HTML file transfers of the earlier days to he more recent automated tools. <br>
        Reading through the various readings has given me an interesting view on how the evolution of the internet.
        
         <h1>The Evolution of Web Technology</h1> 
         Many aspects of the modern intern seem to have been accurately predicated by by Borges (1941).<br>
         His idea of an endless library with every possible letter combination reflects the <br>
          information overload we face daily. We face similar difficulties in the era of search engines <br>
          and social media just like Borges' librarians did when they were trying to locate relevant <br>
          material among the many choices. </p>
          <br>
         <p> Accord to The History of the Web (2017) Flash's history from 1995 to 2020 provides an engaging account of the development of online technologies. <br>
            It started out as a technique to create interactive content while HTML was still in its early stages, spread widely thanks to websites like YouTube, and finally gave way to open web standards. <br>
            Through these readings I have noticed a trend in web tech: innovation, adoption, and then replacement.</p>
            <br>

            <h1>Interesting Facts I learned from the Readings</h1>
            <p>I learned a few fascinating facts from these readings that altered the way I view the internet. <br>
            The concepts of web and hypertext existed way before there was technology that was able to support them. Vannevar Bush's Memex vision of (1945) paralles Borges' (1941) Library of Babel. 
            <br>Both of them visualised systems for organising and connecting large amounts of information.</p>
            <br>

            <h1>Goals for this Course:</h1>
            <p>With platforms like GitHub pages, the modern web development landscape represents both return and evolution of web's origins.<br>
                 I am looking forward to learning more about how technologies come and go, and learn how to build these platforms, being part of this ongoing evolution of how we access and share information online. <br>
                 I also want to be proficient in reactive web development together with version control like GitHub.
                Making content accessible, finding a balance between usefulness and simplicity, and developing general standards are all issues that early web developers faced in the olden days; that modern developers still face today.
                <br> Knowing this history makes it easier for me to recognize the fundamental issues that still exist as well as the progress we've made.</p>

        <h1>WEEK 2: Blog Post</h1>
        <br>
        <h1> Reflection on Moulthrop (2003) You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media</h1>
        <br>
        <p> In conversations about the future of the internet, Moulthrop's (2003) analysis of hypertext and its revolutionary potential is still very relevant. 
            <br>
            His use of McLuhan's four laws of media offers a framework for understanding how hypertext has evolved from being a decentralized space to becoming a one that is more controlled by corporations and algorithms. The idea that hypertext will eventually serve as a television substitute, moving from passive consumption to interactive involvement, was one of Moulthrop's main worries (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 692). 
            <br> The digital environment of today, where social media platforms, streaming services, and algorithm-driven content promote engagement while also influencing user experience in ways that favor corporate interests, matches up with this prediction.
            Moulthrop also points out that hypertext could backfire on its original promise of participation and open access, turning into a tool for power (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 700). The decentralized potential that was once imagined for the internet is now limited by the substantial control that platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have over information flows. 
            <br>Concerns regarding data collection, surveillance capitalism, and the monopolization of digital spaces are reflected in the contradiction he illustrates, where a technology intended to improve user agency might instead turn into a tool of control.
            <br>
            Moulthrop's concept of hypertext as a "docuverse" that has the potential to assist or hinder data access is relevant to the ongoing discussions surrounding internet privacy and the commercialization of data (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 694). The widespread use of private algorithms and data-driven advertising indicates that the web has evolved into a more regulated marketplace than an open network, even though sites like Wikipedia and open-source projects demonstrate the democratic possibilities of hypertext. Ultimately, Moulthrop’s reflections push us to question whether the internet today is still capable of being revolutionary or if it has been absorbed into a cycle of corporate consolidation, much like previous media forms (Moulthrop, 2003, p 702).

            <h1>Folder Structure:</h1>
            
         <p> Each category (home, Essays, Blogs, portfolio, Design Process, About) gets its own folder with an index.html , styles.css & scripts.js file ensuring proper organization. 
        <br>The /images folder houses shared media, while /scripts and /styles store reusable JavaScript and CSS files.
        </p>

            <h1>URL Scheme:</h1>
            
          <ul> 
            <li>website.com/ → Home</li>
            <li>website.com/essays/ → Essays page</li>
            <li> website.com/blogs/ → Blogs page</li>
            <li>website.com/portfolio/ → Portfolio page</li>
            <li>website.com/design-process/ → Design Process page</li>
            <li>website.com/about/ → About page</li>
          </ul>  
           <p> This structure keeps the URLs responsive and intuitive, readable, and SEO friendly. </p> 
    
        
        <h1> Interaction:</h1>
            
        <p>To me, interaction is about user agency; allowing website visitors to engage with the content rather than just passively consuming it.</p> 
        
        <ul>
           <li>  Interactive elements -like hovering effects, animated buttons and dynamic images.</li>
            <li> User feedback mechanisms - comments likes on blog posts would be cool</li>
            <li>Dynamic content - filters for portfolio/game projects</li>
            <li>Personalization - light/dark mode, adjustable layout preferences maybe not we’ll see.</li>
        </ul>
