        <h1> Reflection on Moulthrop (2003) You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media</h1>
        <br>
        <p> In conversations about the future of the internet, Moulthrop's (2003) analysis of hypertext and its revolutionary potential is still very relevant. 
            <br>
            His use of McLuhan's four laws of media offers a framework for understanding how hypertext has evolved from being a decentralized space to becoming a one that is more controlled by corporations and algorithms. The idea that hypertext will eventually serve as a television substitute, moving from passive consumption to interactive involvement, was one of Moulthrop's main worries (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 692). 
            <br> The digital environment of today, where social media platforms, streaming services, and algorithm-driven content promote engagement while also influencing user experience in ways that favor corporate interests, matches up with this prediction.
            Moulthrop also points out that hypertext could backfire on its original promise of participation and open access, turning into a tool for power (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 700). The decentralized potential that was once imagined for the internet is now limited by the substantial control that platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have over information flows. 
            <br>Concerns regarding data collection, surveillance capitalism, and the monopolization of digital spaces are reflected in the contradiction he illustrates, where a technology intended to improve user agency might instead turn into a tool of control.
            <br>
            Moulthrop's concept of hypertext as a "docuverse" that has the potential to assist or hinder data access is relevant to the ongoing discussions surrounding internet privacy and the commercialization of data (Moulthrop, 2003, p. 694). The widespread use of private algorithms and data-driven advertising indicates that the web has evolved into a more regulated marketplace than an open network, even though sites like Wikipedia and open-source projects demonstrate the democratic possibilities of hypertext. Ultimately, Moulthrop’s reflections push us to question whether the internet today is still capable of being revolutionary or if it has been absorbed into a cycle of corporate consolidation, much like previous media forms (Moulthrop, 2003, p 702).

            <h1>Folder Structure:</h1>
            
         <p> Each category (home, Essays, Blogs, portfolio, Design Process, About) gets its own folder with an index.html , styles.css & scripts.js file ensuring proper organization. 
        <br>The /images folder houses shared media, while /scripts and /styles store reusable JavaScript and CSS files.
        </p>

            <h1>URL Scheme:</h1>
            
          <ul> 
            <li> <a href="../index.html" target="_blank"> website.com/ → Home</a></li>
            <li> <a href="../essays/index.html">website.com/essays/ → Essays page</a></li>
            <li> <a href="../blogs/index.html">website.com/blogs/ → Blogs page</a></li>
        
            <li>website.com/portfolio/ → Portfolio page</li>
            <li>website.com/design-process/ → Design Process page</li>
            <li>website.com/about/ → About page</li>
          </ul>  
           <p> This structure keeps the URLs responsive and intuitive, readable, and SEO friendly. </p> 
    
        
        <h1> Interaction:</h1>
            
        <p>To me, interaction is about user agency; allowing website visitors to engage with the content rather than just passively consuming it.</p> 
        
        <ul>
           <li>  Interactive elements -like hovering effects, animated buttons and dynamic images.</li>
            <li> User feedback mechanisms - comments likes on blog posts would be cool</li>
            <li>Dynamic content - filters for portfolio/game projects</li>
            <li>Personalization - light/dark mode, adjustable layout preferences maybe not we’ll see.</li>
        </ul>
