                <h2>Development Progress Reflection:</h2>
                <p>My current implementation aligns with the structure of the website that I have planned on exploring. It does not exactly align with it though. Since I have drafted my wireframes; the navigation bar clearly communicates the structure of the website. The basic HTML can be found on my page but I have not implemented any of the functionality.</p>
