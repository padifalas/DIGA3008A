                or icons indicating the category of work (e.g., "Game Design,"
                "Short Story," "Essay"), helping visitors navigate content based

                posts, or contacting the me. Buttons will be designed with soft,
                rounded edges to maintain a friendly and approachable aesthetic.
                Each button will have a designated color based on its
                importance—primary actions like "View Portfolio" will be in warm
                peach, while secondary actions like "Read More" will use muted
                lilac. To reinforce interactivity, buttons will have a slight

                create an engaging and responsive experience. When users hover
                over a button, it will slightly darken or shift in color,
                indicating interactivity. Icons will feature a subtle bounce or
                color transition when hovered over, providing visual feedback.

                throughout the site. These icons will include social media links
                such as GitHub and Itch.io back and forward arrows for
                navigation, and play or download buttons for interactive
                content. To ensure clarity, all icons will be kept at a

            These dynamic components work together to keep the website
            interesting, user-friendly, and accessible. A well-designed
            navigation system will make it easy for users to browse the website,
            and the animations and transitions i have planned will hopefully
            make interactions feel fluid and natural. The objective is to
            produce an experience that captures the dual character of the my
            work work: Immersive and Expressive like storytelling, but also
            Structured and Logical.

          <p>
            I want to create an ideally structured but visually interesting
            experienceing for the visitors of the website. To this I am planning
            on making using of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Grid-Based Layout -</strong> The Project and Blog Cards
              will be organized in this manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use of White Space -</strong> This is to ensure that the
              site feels clean, breathable and not overwhelming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information Hierarchy -</strong> Clear Typography,
              spacing, and good focus on complementing colors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Balance - </strong>I also want to there to be a balance
              between Tech and Creative Visuals, near pastel-dark fantasy
              aesthetics meet structured UI to match my brand Identity of being
              both a Storyteller; and Game & Web Developer
            </li>

            The design was influenced by a combination of game UI trends,
            storytelling-focused portfolios, and developer-friendly layouts.

          <p>
            I especially like the layout of how the game projects were
            showcased. With the genre and description included.

          <p>
            I like how that the cover of the short story/narrative is show as a
            thumbnail. The author, published date genre and name of the piece is
            also highlighted on the left. The synopsis is also descripbed just
            on the bottom. The website also has Recent Posts and a categories
            filter and search section which I want to include in my Portfolio
            page.

                <li><strong>Desktop (1025px+):</strong> Three or four-column grid, expanded navigation</li>
                <li><strong>Large Desktop (1440px+):</strong> Maximum content width of 1200px with centered layout</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Key responsive adaptations include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Font size reduction of 10-15% on mobile devices</li>
                <li>Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px × 44px) for mobile interfaces</li>
                <li>Collapsible sections on smaller screens to prioritize critical content</li>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Core layout and navigation structure</li>
              <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Portfolio and project showcases</li>
              <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Blog and essay content integration</li>
              <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Interactive elements and animations</li>
              <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Responsive optimizations and testing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This phased approach allows for continuous evaluation and refinement throughout the development process.</p>
