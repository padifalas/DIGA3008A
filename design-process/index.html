    <section class="e-content">
    <h2><strong>UI Components & Interactive Elements:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Navigation Bar:</strong></p>
        <p>The Nav Bar is a critical component of the user experience, providing a consistent and intuitive way for visitors to explore different pages.
             Positioned at the top of the page, it remains fixed as users scroll, ensuring seamless navigation.
              In the Portfolio Page, The bar will feature dropdown menus for filtering portfolio content, such as game projects and short stories, allowing users to find specific work efficiently.
               Hover effects will highlight active links, and a slight animation will provide visual feedback when a selection is made. For accessibility, high contrast will be maintained between the text and background, and a clear, readable font will be used.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Project Cards:</strong></p>
                <p>These serve as interactive thumbnails for website content and items, offering a structured and visually appealing way to present work. 
                Each card will display a representative image, title, and short description. When a user hovers over a card, the background color will subtly shift or expand, and a short preview of additional details will fade in. Clicking a card will either expand it into a modal window or redirect the user to a dedicated project page. These cards will also include small tags or icons indicating the category of work (e.g., "Game Design," "Short Story," "Essay"), helping visitors navigate content based on their interests.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Call To Action Elements (Rounded Buttons):</strong></p>
                <p>CTA's such as rounded buttons will guide users toward key interactions, such as exploring the portfolio, reading blog posts, or contacting the me.
                     Buttons will be designed with soft, rounded edges to maintain a friendly and approachable aesthetic. Each button will have a designated color based on its importance—primary actions like "View Portfolio" will be in warm peach, while secondary actions like "Read More" will use muted lilac. 
                     To reinforce interactivity, buttons will have a slight hover and press effect when clicked, giving the impression of real-world touch feedback.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Hover Animations:</strong></p>
                <p>Microinteractions will be integrated throughout the website to create an engaging and responsive experience. When users hover over a button, it will slightly darken or shift in color, indicating interactivity. Icons will feature a subtle bounce or color transition when hovered over, providing visual feedback. 
                    Project and Blog cards may have a gentle zoom effect when hovered to create a sense of depth. These small interactions ensure that users feel connected to the interface without overwhelming them with excessive motion or distractions</p>
            </li>  
            <li>
                <p><strong>Icons:</strong></p>
                <p>These will play an important role in the navigation and interaction design, serving as visual guides for users. The design will maintain consistency by using  outlined icons throughout the site. These icons will include social media links such as GitHub and Itch.io back and forward arrows for navigation, and play or download buttons for interactive content. 
                    To ensure clarity, all icons will be kept at a consistent size, with sufficient spacing between elements to prevent visual clutter.</p>
            </li>  
    </ul>
    <p>These dynamic components work together to keep the website interesting, user-friendly, and accessible.
         A well-designed navigation system will make it easy for users to browse the website, and the animations and transitions i have planned will hopefully make interactions feel fluid and natural. 
         The objective is to produce an experience that captures the dual character of the my work work: Immersive and Expressive like storytelling, but also Structured and Logical.</p>
